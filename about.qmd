My name is Daniel Hassler, and I am currently a Master's in Computer Science student at Virginia Tech focusing in AI/ML. My academic areas of interest fall under AI/ML, robotics, and networking. 

This fall, I am involved in interesting areas of research for a few of my classes. In my "Nautral Language Processing" (NLP) class, I am researching in-context learning for LLMs, and in my "Security in Generative AI" class, I am researching defense mechanisms against deep learning facial recognition attacks utilizing generative AI.

Prior to being a graduate student at VT, my experience is mostly academic, as I recently graduated from James Madison University with my B.S. in Computer Science ('23). At JMU, I was part of an exciting research project where I got to help design safety features for the JMU Autonomous Golf Cart (JACart) with ML and computer vision technologies.
